E5 Coral is a team formed by six research labs from top public U.S. universities that work together to predict phenotypic and eco-evolutionary consequences of environmental energetic epigenetic linkages.

This project uses symbiotic, metabolically complex reef-building corals as a model system to test the connections between physiological, epigenetic, and metabolic states, and predict how population and community dynamics are influenced by epigenetically-modulated phenotypes.
